  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a force to be reckoned with on the internet and in the economy overall. Its applications developed in either Android OS or iOS for remotely operating IoT devices. Currently, since software engineers suffer from the lack of programming experience or deadline pressure, some snippets of code directly copied and pasted to other places for similar functionalities, which called duplicate code. Duplicate code is an essential code smell and leads to several adverse impacts of duplicate code in traditional software. Moreover, duplicate code may occupy more system resources in IoT applications that are unable to be afforded by IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to detect duplicate code based on the geometric center. The monotonicity of geometric center utilized to determine whether any pair-wise methods are duplicate, which gives the multiformity for detecting different types of duplicate code. This methodology not only effectively detects the duplicate code but also outperforms the result of prior research on coverage and time consumption.}

  abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the end-users may remotely control their IoT devices via their Android devices. The developers may request some unnecessary permissions and request sensitive permission access every time without checking the granted status, which leads to the risk of over privilege and privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a methodology used to detect two kinds of permission smells on Android devices by similarity coefficient and depth-first search algorithm to assist the developers in detecting the Android-specific smells during development.},

  abstract={Web attack detection is an important part of web security. As our society already depends heavily on web technologies, web attacks can actually cause serious problems such as economic losses, data leakage, business interruption and even attacks on Internet of Thing devices that affect personal and social security. In order to prevent such disasters, we propose a web attack detection approach based on ResNet and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU). In this approach, Word2vec is used to extract features of HTTP request URL with which detection model is trained using ResNet and GRU. As a result, our approach can greatly improve model training speed and web attack detection accuracy and recall.},

  abstract={Android is the most popular mobile system in the world where many applications provide convenient and diverse functions on top of it for our daily lives. However, a new Android malware is revealed every 10 seconds and the official application markets still consists of malicious and undetected applications due to the limitation of the existing malware detection techniques. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify the latent Android malware from application’s description using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique. The actual permissions requested by source code and permissions predicted from the description using semantics analysis to are compared to verify the consistency. If an application requests a permission undeclared in the description or homogeneous applications, it will be considered as a latent Android malware. This approach can surely provide more secure environment for the end-users before they install the applications.},

  abstract={As malicious apps vary significantly across Android malware, it is challenging to prevent that the end-users download apps from unsecured app markets. In this paper, we propose an approach to classify the malicious methods based on permissions using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that is used to embed the semantics among Intent and permissions. Then the malicious method that is an unsecured method will be removed and re-uploaded to official market. This approach may induce that the end-users download apps from official markets in order to reduce the risk of attacks.},

  title={Classification of Concurrent Anomalies for IoT Software based Support Vector Machine},
  author={Zhiqiang Wu and Asad Abbas and Xin Chen and Scott Uk-Jin Lee},
  abstract={Internet of Thing (IoT) can connect anyone with anything at any point in any place. Currently, growing number of IoT devices have become a major role of daily life owing to their convenience. The IoT devices usually controlled by Web applications and mobile applications, which will process lots of events from user’s controller to devices. Hence, such software is a kind of concurrent program in IoT environment because the software is unable to simultaneously process these events, which may cause the concurrent issue. There is event-drive model in either Web application or mobile applications, which is unable to easily detect the concurrent anomaly by existing approaches due to the non-determined of execution and hardly reproduced by the same sequence. The previous techniques of concurrent detection are excessive limitations that only used for one of concurrent anomaly with the large number of false positive. In this paper, we describe a novel methodology to dynamically classify two types of concurrent anomalies for IoT software. According to the executable sequence graph, we generate the training and test examples for classification. The vectorization features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel. The SVM will predict the concurrent state of current executable example. As a result, the optimal true positive of simulation is 80% in our experiment which is a higher accuracy than others.},

  abstract={Mobile applications became integral part of our daily life as they provide excellent portability and convenience. Growing number of features in mobile applications enables diverse user actions, sensors data and information to be inputted using various operations. Since mobile applications are event-driven programs, it is very difficult to detect concurrency anomaly with existing methodologies and tool supports due to the non-deterministic executions and difficulties in reproducing execution sequences for testing. The existing techniques of concurrent anomaly detection are very limited as they are often focused on detecting a specific concurrent anomaly without providing a generic approach. Furthermore, they produce large number of false positive in their detection results. Therefore, we propose a novel technique to dynamically classify concurrent anomalies for event-driven applications. According to control flow graph and vector clocks, we manually generate the training and test examples for classification using support vector machine with Gaussian kernel. The support vector machine will effectively predict whether the application under test is anomaly or not. We also have conducted experiments to determined accuracy of the proposed methodology. As result, the accuracy of proposed prediction methodology reached 80% with 20% of false positive rate. When compared with other related works, the proposed methodologies with machine learning technique is proven to be more efficient and effective.}

  abstract={Software Product Line (SPL) is used for the development of multiple products from same domain with reusability of existing resources. Feature model is used to manage the existing resources of SPL with predefined notations and relationships such as mandatory and variable features. Multiple SPLs that have common features with own contextual presence in domain repository needs to be managed efficiently to increase the reusability and development process. In this paper, we have proposed effective approach for the composition of multiple SPLs that have common resources in repository. Our proposed composition process follows the three steps procedure. The impact of composition on application development is less cost and time, and increase the reusability.},

  abstract={Order Scheduling in product supply chain is an important activity to adequately manage cash flow for supplier. However, in current order scheduling, deadlock may appear when managing multiple supply chain flows simultaneously. This paper proposes a deadlock avoidance method for order scheduling in product supply chain system by adopting Banker’s algorithm which is a commonly used in operating systems for deadlock avoidance. After thorough analysis and comparisons, Banker’s algorithm is utilized to manage order scheduling in product supply chain instead of managing memories in operating systems. As a result, order scheduling can be managed effectively with dramatically less chances of deadlock when handling multiple orders. To verify the proposed method, SPIN is used to simulate and verify the correctness.},

  abstract={Development of specific product with high reusability of existing resources, Software Product Line (SPL) is vastly used. Feature model is used to maintain the features of SPL in systematic way with common and variable features. Variable features differentiate the products of SPL domain. Optimization is required to find all possible combination of features for specific product under constraints and requirement of stakeholder. Multiple requirements and objectives from stakeholder make it hard to select best feature selection. Different multiobjective optimization algorithms are used in industry to get best optimized feature selection from feature model. In this paper we identify challenges and issues after systematic review of popular algorithms and their optimized results in large and small scale feature models. },

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is best paradigm to build new products with high reusability from existing resources. Feature model is commonly used for resource management with variable and common features under product line. Key idea of feature model is to manage commonalities and variabilities of resources with mandatory, alternative and optional features. Crosscutting concerns are tangled and scattered in overall system which reduce the reusability of resources because of dependency with other features. At modeling level, the identification of these features is an important task to construct them as a separate aspect module. As a result, the addition or deletion of these aspects do not affect the system. In this paper we present: (1) an approach to find crosscutting concerns by using union-find algorithm, (2) genetic algorithm for optimized feature selection with resource constraints and crosscutting concerns. },

The system enables the management of attendance records through the use of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 5 and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The existing attendance systems lacks efficiency as they require students to manually sign the attendance list. As a result, students often skip lectures after signing the list causing false attendance to be recorded. Therefore, this system proposes automatic capture of student's photo with web-camera when students check their card at RFID reader. Such system provides great help to the lecturers to keep track of students’ attendance records correctly. },
